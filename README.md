# open-dis7-java Library

This project provides a complete type-safe Java implementation of the IEEE Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Protocol.

Current support includes IEEE DIS Protocol version 7 (IEEE 1278.1-2012) 
and Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization SISO-REF-010 Enumerations specifications.
The majority of source code is autogenerated by the
[open-dis7-source-generator](https://github.com/open-dis/open-dis7-source-generator) project.

Also available:

Additional test programs and resources are found in the NPS MOVES

Recent project products include DIS stream-handling support.
